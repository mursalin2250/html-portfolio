    <dt>Website</dt>
    <dd>
        A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is 
        identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.  <br>
        Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, 
        entertainment or social networking.
    </dd>
    <dt>Domain</dt>
    <dd>  
        -A domain is essentially your website's address on the internet. 
        It's the unique name that people type into their web browsers to find your site. <br>
        Think of it like your home address in the real world. Just like your home has a physical address 
        that lets people know where to find you, your website has a domain name that helps people 
        find your site online.
    </dd>
    <dt>Hosting</dt>
    <dd>
        Hosting, in the realm of the internet, refers to the service that provides the storage space and 
        technical infrastructure necessary for your website or web application to be accessible online. <br> 
        Imagine it as the digital land where your website's virtual house is built. Just like a physical house 
        needs land to stand on, your website needs hosting to exist and be visible on the internet.
    </dd>
    <dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>
        -HTML or Hyper text markup language defines the content and layout of web pages using elements like 
        headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. </br> It serves as the skeleton that gives a website 
        its basic structure and organization.
    </dd>
    <dt>CSS</dt>
    <dd>
        -CSS or cascading style sheet styles the appearance of HTML elements, 
        controlling fonts, colors, spacing, layouts, and even animations. </br>
        It transforms a plain HTML structure into an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience.
    </dd>
    <dt>Javascript</dt>
    <dd>
        -It adds dynamic behavior and interactivity to web pages, making them more engaging and responsive. </br>
        JavaScript enables features like animations, form validation, user interactions, and real-time updates.
    </dd>
    <dt>CMS</dt>
    <dd>
        -Content Management System (CMS) is the control panel for your website. 
        It's the interface you use to build, edit, and manage your content, like adding text, images, or videos. </br>
        Think of it as the captain's helm, guiding your ship's course and making sure everything runs smoothly.
    </dd>
    <dt>Market Place</dt>
    <dd>
        -Marketplaces are bustling hubs where you can find additional tools and resources to enhance your 
        website. </br> From themes and plugins to SEO tools and security services, these online marketplaces 
        offer a treasure trove of options to equip your ship for any adventure.
